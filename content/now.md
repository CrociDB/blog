### Tech and Development

 - Working on a web game, still unannounced
 - Working on a RSS/ATOM feed reader app for the terminal, in Rust
 - Studying the Linux kernel, bit by bit

### Art

 - Studying drawing. I have recently started drawing, now I'm enrolled in an online drawing course with a very experience brazilian comic book artist and illustrator. Really excited for that.

 <!-- - Working on a small Android app to add color frame to photos that I can post on social media. I know there's a plethora of apps that do exactly that, but the one I really liked using is not supported anymore, so I decided to create my own with Flutter. Will probably release that for free with ads when it's ready. -->

<!-- ### Music -->

<!-- Finishing a music project. It's an instrumental psychedelic rock with some influences from brazilian music. I composed, recorded all instruments, produced and mixed everything. It's been a really interesting journey. I'll blog about it when I'm done. -->
