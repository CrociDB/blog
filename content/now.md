### Tech and Development

 - Working on a web game, still unannounced
 - Building a small project with the Flipper Zero and an ESP8266

 <!-- - Working on a small Android app to add color frame to photos that I can post on social media. I know there's a plethora of apps that do exactly that, but the one I really liked using is not supported anymore, so I decided to create my own with Flutter. Will probably release that for free with ads when it's ready. -->

### Music

Finishing a music project. It's an instrumental psychedelic rock with some influences from brazilian music. I composed, recorded all instruments, produced and mixed everything. It's been a really interesting journey. I'll blog about it when I'm done.
