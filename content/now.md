### Tech and Development

 - Working on a web game, still unannounced.

 <!-- - Working on a small Android app to add color frame to photos that I can post on social media. I know there's a plethora of apps that do exactly that, but the one I really liked using is not supported anymore, so I decided to create my own with Flutter. Will probably release that for free with ads when it's ready. -->

### Drawing and Painting

I recently started drawing and painting watercolor, so I've been doing a lot of it. Exploring styles and themes, keeping a sketchbook, trying techniques.

### Music

I'm working on a music project. Writing, recording and producing some instrumental music (mostly guitar, bass, drums and synth).
