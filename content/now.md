### Life

I've been trying to change the way I eat lately. Started cooking way more often and I realized I love cooking the feeling of eating fresh food I just made. I'm not a vegetarian nor a vegan, but I'm mostly interested in cooking vegan dishes. Mostly using fresh vegetables and legumes, I'm trying to get the most flavor out of these ingredients. I do cook fish every now and then, as it's my favorite type of meat.

Most part of my life after I left my mom's was eating sandwiches and ultra-processed food. I thought that if I cooked I wouldn't have time for anything else. I'd also eat out and order a lot of delivery food. I'm so happy I changed that and most days I look forward for that time I'll be in the kitchen.

### Tech and Development

 - Working on a small web game, still secret. Sharping my Javascript skills.
 - Working on the BitTorrent challenge from [CodeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/healthy-otter-219488), in Zig. As my friend said, _practicing recreative programming_.
 - Working on [flingern](https://github.com/CrociDB/flingern), a _photography gallery static website generator_. Currently implementing a feature to display photography projects rather than just galleries, similar to [Safelight Paper](https://safelightpaper.com/). I'm thinking of a way to have the player control the layout of the images directly from the Markdown.

 <!-- - Working on a small Android app to add color frame to photos that I can post on social media. I know there's a plethora of apps that do exactly that, but the one I really liked using is not supported anymore, so I decided to create my own with Flutter. Will probably release that for free with ads when it's ready. -->

### Photography

Slowly posting all the photos I took in my last holidays in Portugal to my [Instagram Page](https://instagram.com/crocidb):

I'm currently working on a photography project of _Arte XÃ¡vega_, an old fishing method still practiced in some beaches in Portugal. Did some cool photos of it during my holidays in the country and now I'm building the project. Will be the first project that I'll display using this new feature of **flingern** I'm working on.

### Music

I'm working on a music project. Writing, recording and producing some instrumental music (mostly guitar, bass, drums and synth).
