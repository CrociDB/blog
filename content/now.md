### Tech and Development

 - Working on a full version of Spacebar Clicker
 - Working on [bulletty](https://github.com/CrociDB/bulletty), a TUI RSS/ATOM feed reader app for the terminal, in Rust
 - Building a programmable guitar pedal based on GuitarML's [FunBox](https://github.com/GuitarML/FunBox)

### Art

 - Studying drawing. I recently started learning to draw and am now enrolled in an online course taught by a highly experienced Brazilian comic book artist and illustrator, Rafael Coutinho.

 <!-- - Working on a small Android app to add color frame to photos that I can post on social media. I know there's a plethora of apps that do exactly that, but the one I really liked using is not supported anymore, so I decided to create my own with Flutter. Will probably release that for free with ads when it's ready. -->

<!-- ### Music -->

<!-- Finishing a music project. It's an instrumental psychedelic rock with some influences from brazilian music. I composed, recorded all instruments, produced and mixed everything. It's been a really interesting journey. I'll blog about it when I'm done. -->
