### Tech and Development

 - Working on a small web game, still secret. Sharping my Javascript skills.
 - Working on a small Android app to add color frame to photos that I can post on social media. I know there's a plethora of apps that do exactly that, but the one I really liked using is not supported anymore, so I decided to create my own with Flutter. Will probably release that for free with ads when it's ready.
 - Working on [flingern](https://github.com/CrociDB/flingern), a _photography gallery static website generator_. Currently implementing a feature to display photography projects rather than just galleries, similar to [Safelight Paper](https://safelightpaper.com/). I'm thinking of a way to have the player control the layout of the images directly from the Markdown.
 - Practicing a lot my neovim skills (with NVChad) lately, mostly using it as my main editor outside work (where I use Visual Studio).
 - Experimenting with automatic generation of TikTok videos out of blog texts.

### Photography

My recent obssesion with photography is an experiment I'm doing with a full-spectrum camera (that captures ultra-violet and infra-red light along with the visible spectrum) and a wide lens. Especially on sunny days, it can capture really interesting images such as this:

I think it makes for such a surreal imagery with colors that pop unnaturally. The constrast of the bright blue sky with the pink-ish tones of the infrared light reflecting off from pretty all clothes make me really happy.

I'm currently working on a photography project of _Arte XÃ¡vega_, an old fishing method still practiced in some beaches in Portugal. Did some cool photos of it during my holidays in the country and now I'm building the project. Will be the first project that I'll display using this new feature of **flingern** I'm working on.

### Music

I'm working on a music project. Writing, recording and producing some instrumental music (mostly guitar, bass, drums and synth), I hope to release digitally as an EP or a short Album by the end of this year.

### Reading

I've been reading a lot of **Dylan Dog** lately, the classic italian comics. I read some for the first time in Portugal, after browsing bookstores in Porto and Lisbon for comics. Now back in Germany, I bought a few other issues, but in German. Maybe it's also a good reason to force me study more the language?
