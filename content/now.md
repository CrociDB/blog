### Life

I've been trying to change the way I eat lately. Started cooking way more often and I realized I love the feeling of eating fresh food I just made. I'm not a vegetarian nor a vegan, but I'm mostly interested in cooking vegan dishes. Mostly using fresh vegetables and legumes, I'm trying to get the most flavor out of these ingredients. I do cook fish every now and then, as it's my favorite type of meat.

Most part of my life after I left my mom's was eating sandwiches and ultra-processed food. I thought that if I cooked I wouldn't have time for anything else. I'd also eat out and order a lot of delivery food. I'm so happy I changed that and most days I look forward for that time I'll be in the kitchen.

### Tech and Development

 - Working on a web game, still unannounced.

 <!-- - Working on a small Android app to add color frame to photos that I can post on social media. I know there's a plethora of apps that do exactly that, but the one I really liked using is not supported anymore, so I decided to create my own with Flutter. Will probably release that for free with ads when it's ready. -->

### Drawing and Painting

I recently started drawing and painting watercolor, so I've been doing a lot of it. Exploring styles and themes, keeping a sketchbook, trying techniques.

### Music

I'm working on a music project. Writing, recording and producing some instrumental music (mostly guitar, bass, drums and synth).
