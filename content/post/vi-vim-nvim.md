When I first heard of **Vi**, it was actually **Vim**. But people liked to call it _V-I_, so it was common for people to add aliases to call it _vi_: `alias vi=vim` was a common line in people's shell profiles. After the current **NeoVim** craze, with lots of influencer creating content on it and tons of new users ([myself included](/post/from-ides-to-the-terminal), I see the interesting effect of people creating aliases to invoke **NeoVim** with `vim`. `alias vim=nvim`, (myself incldued).

I wonder when the next big editor comes, in a decade or so, let's call it **UltraNeoVim**, `unvim`, people will start invoking it with `nvim`. `alias nvim=unvim`.
