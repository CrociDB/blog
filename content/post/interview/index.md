Back in 2008, I was in my last year of high school (or _medium school_, as we call in Brazil) and I learned about this program called **Students2Business** by Microsoft. That was basically a couple-month class on their development platform that would connect a student to a brand new intern job in a _dream_ corporate company.

I've been programming little games for fun since 2002, when I was 11 years old, and I was finally leaving school and getting ready for university. But I come from a humble family, living in Guarulhos, a nearby city of São Paulo that had fewer opportunities in technology, and I had no other option than finding a job and work as I studied my way into my new programming career. Microsoft's S2B sounded like a big opportunity to land myself a good-paying half-period job to help my family and myself during those years.

It all started with a programming assignment to get into the program. Then after some weeks of classes every other day, another assignment for phase 2, and there were a total 4 or 5 phases. I had to skip some days at school, but we discussed with the school managers and I proposed I was gonna deliver some homework to prove I was studying the subjects. The place where the S2B classes happened were too far away from home, more than 2-hour commute, thanks to my uncle who would wake up a lot earlier than usual and give me a ride to his job, that was a lot closer (still 1+ hour bus ride from there).

I made my way to one of the last phases and had several .NET classes, assignments and projects. But more importantly, there lied the interview with big companies for an intern position. I remember this one company position specifically: they made ERP software. At the end of one class, they said "whoever wants to apply for this company, we'll apply a programming test tomorrow". It looked like a big corporate company, their office was in one of the most expensive/commercial areas of São Paulo, very close to this recently-open bridge that turned out to be a postcard of the city. I remember well they were offering a R$ 1,500.00 monthly compensation for one year of internship and high possibility of getting hired as a Junior afterwards. That number was incredibly good for me, an 18 year-old boy. My dad, who passed away in a traffic accident (commuting from Job1 to Job2) three years before, worked 15 hours a day and was making only around 1k a month only.

Back then, I was informally working for this guy making websites for small business in Guarulhos, in my free time after school. He paid R$ 200.00 a month, and that was already pretty exciting, but I was betting all on that internship, that would make my family's life better, I could contribute the household income (that was solely pension from dad's death), and could pay for all my meals and commuting to University, as well as books and all the studying material I would need.

Of course I always wanted to be a video game developer, but working as programmer was a good start. I did the test and the next day, one of the class staff told me informally they were impressed with my results, because I scored the highest, even though I was one of the youngest in there. It gave me more confidence. A week later they scheduled an interview. 

I wore a social outfit, oversized white button shirt, black pants and a pair of shoes that completely destroyed my feet. My mom took a photo of me before leaving, because I was looking good. Then I walked towards my first bus-stop of the day. Took a bus, a metro, another metro, another metro and a train and after around two and a half hour I arrived at their office, all I remember is that amount of natural light coming through the big windows facing the newly constructed bridge. I sat there with other young people, all waiting for their turn to being interviewed for an internship position.

When it was my time, I entered the meeting room and there were three people: a tech person, a manager and... a psychologist! That was so confusing, but I took it as a good thing back then, after all they want to check how I fit with the company. The conversation started with some very awkward moments that I can't forget, stuff like "oh, so... _Croci_... are you an italian ascendant?", "makes sense, by your nose I would say either arabic or italian". No technical questions were asked, but they appraised my test. Most of the questions were the cliché interview questions you probably heard too. "Where do you see yourself within the next five years?", "If you were to be an animal, what type of animal would you be?", "What's the person you admire the most?", and more personal questions like "I can see you bite your nails, are you a nervous person? Does that affect your life?", all stuff that an unprepared eighteen year old can't even reason about.

I left with a bit of a bittersweet taste in my mouth. My mom asked if everything went well and I was like "no clue", I was totally lost. But a few days later I got an email inviting me for a "group interview" with other candidates. Sounded like progress, I got excited again.

A week later, same procedure to get to their office, only this time there was a lot more people in there. The same three interviewers, but around 10 competitors. They had a few open positions, so some would get hired, some wouldn't. I was somehow confident, did well on the technical test, managed to get through the non-sense questions the week before, so I just tried my best. 

They put us all in the same room and had us do some activities. All the time there was that reality-show kinda mood, where everybody is together and do stuff together, but they're actually competing. They divided the group into smaller teams and we had to work together to come up with something they proposed. That involved doing some crafting paper product, where each one of us had a different role in our team. After this, they said "you're not making easy for us, let's go one by one and you say your football team and your zodiac sign, we'll pick based on that". What?! I was got angry at that, but not brave enough to question it. I said "Palmeiras, Virgo" on my turn and just expected that to be the lucky one, "Virgo? Oh no..."

One of the candidates in that was a school colleague of mine, he joined the program at the same time I did and we were sharing all that was happening. I helped him do the programming assignments, I gave him spoilers of the programming test for this company and finally told him all about the first interview. He was doing the classes with a different group, so his test and first interview were in a different day than mine. Except for group interview, that we did together. And in the end, his zodiac sign was the lucky one.

He got the internship. A few months later I got an internship as a PHP web developer that paid R$ 400.00, completely unrelated to the program. It was a bit closer to home and it did help me get my way into the first year of university.

For so many years I tried to make sense of all that. I think I probably wasn't a good fit for the company anyway, I lived too far away, I mentioned my target career would be video games, I didn't have the correct outfit to walk that region of the city. Or it was really just my zodiac sign or the football team that my family supported.

I kept insisting and it all worked out fine for me, and I didn't get into that company for the better. But I wonder how many times people are hired in processes completely broken like this one.
