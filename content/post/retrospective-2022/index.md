For the last few years I've been writing a tweet in the end of the year with some of my life achievements, projects and professional changes. This year, based on other blogs I read, I decided to make a more complete post with even more content and include also other interesting things like some of the book I read and important concepts I learned this year.

# Projects

## Blog

This is, of course, one of the most important project and achievement of this year: I finally decided to write more to this blog. I've had blogs for over 15 years, but never really took it so seriously as of now. I read somewhere _"don't think to write, write to think"_ and it got to me so much I decided to write a lot more my projects and experiments. And it's been an amazing journey, I can feel how much writing has improved the way I think and learn about stuff.

My post about **doomoji** made it to the first page of Hacker News and got a lot of upvotes on the `/r/programming` subreddit.

That all gave me more confidence to write more as a tool to learn more and get feedback for silly experiments like that one. I learned so much from the comments and nobody was hostile or pointing problems just for the sake of annoying, as I sadly expected.

## wordlos

Early 2022 was the year that everyone started posting those weird green/yellow/gray boxes to twitter and it took me some time to figure out it was about a new _cult_ word game: *wordle*. Didn't take long after for me to get addicted to it as well. So addicted indeed I also started playing other of the countless variations, such as the [Brazilian Portuguese](https://term.ooo/) version of it.

After having written [retro2048](https://crocidb.github.io/retro2048/), a port of the other [new classic 2048 game to the bootsector](https://crocidb.com/post/bootsector-game/) and DOS, I wanted to do more text-mode assembly games and wordle seemed like a perfect match for my needs. So I took a few weeks to work on it. The result is a perfectly fun wordle version of it that runs on any DOS system.

This is was also the first time I got a pull request on an open-source project I ever wrote. [Paweł Łukasik](https://github.com/pawlos) wrote a fix for an issue with repeating letters and submitted it. It was such a cool moment to see people genuinely interested in a project I made to write a fix and submit a PR.

I didn't write anything about this project around here yet, but I want to at some point, at least about how I made to port it to be played online on itch.io, using a wasm version of DosBox and taking the output framebuffer to be rendered with ThreeJS with a CRT post-processing effect, looking like this:

## Space Lord X

For the first time in my life I finished an entry for Ludum Dare. So many times I started, but left at some point because of my extreme incapacity of making a proper game design.

This time I decided to pretty much clone a game for Atari 2600 that I used to play a lot as a kid, The [Space Master X-7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia4rGNuIh1g&t=10s). Thought that would be a cool experiment to implement in the WASM-4 fantasy console, so this was the result:

![Space Lord X](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTcyOTI2NS8xMDE4NTE1NS5naWY=/original/hWJQ0Y.gif)

It can be played on [itch.io](https://crocidb.itch.io/spacelord-x). I stll haven't written a post about this project here because I'm still working on improvements post-compo such as improving the player movement, boss behaviours and adding sound. I think input issues and the lack of audio really brought the game rating down, but I was very happy with the results.
