Hi. I'm a game programmer for **Ubisoft Düsseldorf**, currently working on the **Assassin's Creed VR** title and based in _Düsseldorf, Germany_. I have several years of experience with VR games, having worked in titles such as **Angest**, **Rock 'n Rails**, **Conflict0: Shattered** and **Jake 'n Tess: Finding Monsters VR**.

My specialties are **Unity3D** and **C#**, since that's what I used most on the professional environment for the last years. But I also worked with a lot different technologies both at work and for personal projects. I would consider myself as a generalist, since I love learning different stuff.

I'm currently working on a personal toy game engine: [annileen](https://github.com/CrociDB/annileen). I have made some cool experiments such as [rendering DOOM with emojis](https://github.com/CrociDB/doomoji), a clone of the classic [2048 game that runs on the bootsector](https://crocidb.github.io/retro2048/), a [gameboy emulator](https://github.com/CrociDB/mygbemu) and [several](https://crocidb.itch.io/phosphorus-dating) [small](https://crocidb.itch.io/mitosis-project) [games](https://crocidb.itch.io/anthority).

You can play my games at [itch.io](https://crocidb.itch.io/), check all my available open source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/CrociDB), see the cool artistic-kinda shaders at [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/crocidb), see my photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/crocidb/) or [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/crocidb/) and maybe follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/CrociDB), where I usually talk about this stuff.

My website bruno.croci.me is also a hub for all my platforms. More about my professional life is available through [Linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/crocidb).
