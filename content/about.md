Hello! I'm a programmer, gamedev and hobbist artist, originally from _São Paulo, Brazil_, now based in _Düsseldorf, Germany_. I'm a very curious and creative person, I feel pleasure by creating things, above everything. As a professional video game programmer, and currently working as a **Senior Audio Programmer** for **Ubisoft Düsseldorf**, my background spans gameplay, generalist, and audio programming. I'm genuinely passionate about all aspects of video game development – diving into everything from engines and systems to graphics, audio, and of course, crafting engaging gameplay. I've had the opportunity to contribute to titles such as **Assassin's Creed Nexus VR**, **XDefiant**, **Angest**, **Rock&Rails**, **Conflict0: Shattered**, and **Jake 'n Tess: Finding Monsters**.

Beyond my professional work, programming remains a significant hobby, providing a constant source of learning and experimentation. Some of my relevant personal projects are [bulletty](https://github.com/CrociDB/bulletty), a TUI feed reader that stores the user data locally; [flingern](https://github.com/CrociDB/flingern), a static art website generator; and my toy game engine, [annileen](https://github.com/CrociDB/annileen). I also enjoy creating unique experiments, like [rendering DOOM with emojis](https://github.com/CrociDB/doomoji), a [2048 game that runs on the bootsector](https://crocidb.github.io/retro2048/), [a Wordle clone for DOS written in x86 asm](https://github.com/CrociDB/wordlos), a [gameboy emulator](https://github.com/CrociDB/mygbemu), and [several](https://crocidb.itch.io/phosphorus-dating) [small](https://crocidb.itch.io/mitosis-project) [games](https://crocidb.itch.io/spacelord-x).

Photography has been one of my main interests throughout my whole life, I'm always carrying a camera around and taking seamingly meaningless pictures. Music production is another big interest for me. I've wrote some small soundtracks for games I made that can be seen on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/bruno-croci) and I'm currently working on an EP. Recently, I started drawing and painting, and it's been such a good way to express thoughts and feelings.
