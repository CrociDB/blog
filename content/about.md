Hello! I'm a video game programmer originally from _São Paulo, Brazil_, now based in _Düsseldorf, Germany_, where I currently work as a **Senior Audio Programmer** for **Ubisoft Düsseldorf**. I've had the opportunity to contribute to titles such as **Assassin's Creed Nexus VR**, **XDefiant**, **Angest**, **Rock&Rails**, **Conflict0: Shattered**, and **Jake 'n Tess: Finding Monsters**.

My professional background spans gameplay, generalist, and audio programming. I'm genuinely passionate about all aspects of video game development – diving into everything from engines and systems to graphics, audio, and of course, crafting engaging gameplay. Beyond my professional work, programming remains a significant hobby, providing a constant source of learning and experimentation. More recently, I've also been exploring my creative side through photography, music, and drawing.

One major personal project is my toy game engine, [annileen](https://github.com/CrociDB/annileen). I also enjoy creating unique experiments, like [rendering DOOM with emojis](https://github.com/CrociDB/doomoji), a [2048 game that runs on the bootsector](https://crocidb.github.io/retro2048/), [a Wordle clone for DOS written in x86 asm](https://github.com/CrociDB/wordlos), a [gameboy emulator](https://github.com/CrociDB/mygbemu), and [several](https://crocidb.itch.io/phosphorus-dating) [small](https://crocidb.itch.io/mitosis-project) [games](https://crocidb.itch.io/spacelord-x).
