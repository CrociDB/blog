Hi. I'm a video game programmer originally from _São Paulo, Brazil_, but based in _Düsseldorf, Germany_. Currently working as an **Audio Programmer** for **Ubisoft Düsseldorf**, I have several years of experience with games. Some of the titles I worked on were **Assassin's Creed Nexus**, **X-Defiant**, **Angest**, **Rock 'n Rails**, **Conflict0: Shattered** and **Jake 'n Tess: Finding Monsters VR**.

Most of my years working as a Gameplay Programmer were using **Unity3D** and **C#**, but I also worked with a lot different technologies both at work and for personal projects. I would consider myself as a generalist, since I love learning different stuff.

One of my current personal projects is a toy game engine: [annileen](https://github.com/CrociDB/annileen). I have also made some cool experiments such as [rendering DOOM with emojis](https://github.com/CrociDB/doomoji), a clone of the classic [2048 game that runs on the bootsector](https://crocidb.github.io/retro2048/), [a Wordle clone for DOS written in x86 asm](https://github.com/CrociDB/wordlos), a [gameboy emulator](https://github.com/CrociDB/mygbemu) and [several](https://crocidb.itch.io/phosphorus-dating) [small](https://crocidb.itch.io/mitosis-project) [games](https://crocidb.itch.io/spacelord-x).

You can play my games at [itch.io](https://crocidb.itch.io/), check all my available open source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/CrociDB), see the cool artistic-kinda shaders at [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/crocidb), see my photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/crocidb/) or [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/crocidb/) and maybe follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/CrociDB), where I usually talk about all this stuff.

This blog is where I about tech, programming, photography or just rambles about random stuff. My website [bruno.croci.me](https://bruno.croci.me/) is a hub for all my platforms. More about my professional life is available through [Linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/crocidb).
