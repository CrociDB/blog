I'm a programmer and game developer currently working for Samsung's **Black River Studio**, at the warm city of Manaus, Brazil. I have previously worked with web developement, but now I'm glad to make part of the brazilian game industry developing games for the mobile platform, mostly Android.

My specialties are **Unity3D**, **C#**, **Flash** and **ActionScript** since that's what I used most on the professional environment for the last four years. But I also worked with a lot different technologies both at work and for personal projects. I would consider myself as a generalist, since I love learning different technologies.

Currently I'm working on a personal project of an Android app. Also trying to get back to an older project of a comic view, the [StewComic](http://crocidb.github.io/stewcomic/), written in **C++** with the fabulous **Qt SDK**. Learning **Haskell** is one of my goals for this year.
