I'm a programmer and game developer currently working for Samsung's **Black River Studios**, at the warm city of Manaus, Brazil. I have previously worked with web developement, but now I'm glad to make part of the brazilian game industry developing games for the mobile and VR platform.

My specialties are **Unity3D**, **C#**, and **Javascript**, since that's what I used most on the professional environment for the last five years. But I also worked with a lot different technologies both at work and for personal projects. I would consider myself as a generalist, since I love learning different technologies.

Currently I'm working on a personal poetry discussion board and some other small projects, all available at my GitHub. I'm also on a quest to study **Functional Programming** and **Graphics Programming**.
